# GitHub Publication Guide

This guide will help you publish the Pangea C++ project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git configured with your credentials (already done)
- Initial commit completed (âœ… Done)

## Steps to Publish

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository" or go to https://github.com/new
3. Repository settings:
   - **Repository name**: `pangea-cpp`
   - **Description**: `Modern C++20 implementation of the Pangea programming language interpreter`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended) or Private
   - **Initialize**: Leave unchecked (we already have files)
   - **Add .gitignore**: None (we already have one)
   - **Add license**: None (we already have MIT license)

### 2. Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pangea-cpp.git

# Set default branch name
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Repository Configuration

After pushing, configure these settings on GitHub:

#### Repository Settings

- Go to Settings â†’ General
- Set default branch to `main`
- Enable "Issues" and "Discussions"
- Enable "Wikis" if you want additional documentation

#### Branch Protection

- Go to Settings â†’ Branches
- Add branch protection rule for `main`:
  - Require pull request reviews before merging
  - Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Include administrators

#### Topics and Description

- Add topics: `c++`, `interpreter`, `programming-language`, `pangea`, `cmake`, `cpp20`
- Ensure description is: "Modern C++20 implementation of the Pangea programming language interpreter"

### 4. Verify GitHub Actions

- Go to Actions tab
- Verify that CI workflow is set up correctly
- The first push should trigger the CI workflow

### 5. Create First Release

Once everything is working:

```bash
# Create and push a tag for v0.1.0
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release of Pangea C++ interpreter"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

This will trigger the release workflow and create binaries.

### 6. Repository URL

Your repository will be available at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pangea-cpp`

## Post-Publication Checklist
